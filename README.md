# TraClusAlgorithm

This is an implementation of TraClus [1] algorithm in Java. A GUI was added for the convenience.

The original paper of this algorithm can be found at http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/pdf/sigmod07_jglee.pdf 
The authors of the paper implemented the algorithm in C++, so it could be helpful to develop one in Java for some 
other users to use. I have compared the output with the one generated by the C++ implementation, so far I have not found
any bugs. It will be great if any one reports any bugs about this implementation.

I am currently involved in a maritime traffic project which requires me to implement various clustering algorithms. So that
is the very first motivation about why I do this implementation. I also implment another clustering algorithm called DBSCANSD
which is proposed during my thesis study and I will put it into the github later.
